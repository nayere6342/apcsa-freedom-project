### **Intro:**

Previously, the main thing I talked about was that I have been working with the python-type game engine called `pygame`. Which uses python as a frame for this game engine. What this import does is it adds a new class which can be used for game objects. But one major thing I realized was that `pygame` isn't a game engine, but instead a game engine. It's actually a library. What a library in python does, it is just a large group of super classes in a series. To put that aside, the main thing that I will go over is making a level on the window. Which is something I will be using in
