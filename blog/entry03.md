### Intro:

Previously, 

### Code Presentation:

To start off this code presentation, - Here is the full preview of the code;     

**Preview:**
```py

```

### Design Process:

Now to break down the code        

### Challenges & Takeaways:

* A challenge I had while working on this was that it was hard to read the code examples online because I thought that pygame was a one to one copy of python but there are a ton of differences to it even though it's just a library.  

* Another challenge that was a real issue was I couldn't find the things I wanted to do like for example a player sprite being able to walk off screen and back. 

* A takeaway I got from this was that I should really start watching more and more videos about `pygame` to really understand how to work with it.

* The last takeaway I got from this was that I needed to tinker with `pygame` to help me to understand how to use it.
