## **Intro:**

For my first blog entry, I have been working with the python-type game engine called `pygame`. Which uses python as a frame for this game engine. What this import does is it adds new class which can be used for game objects. Such as player movement, small classes like that can be useful to make anything from a 2d platformer to a entire story based game. I know it might sound crazy coming from a simple phython import but it can do so much. Since it can stand on it own two legs it will be useful for my flappy bird remix style game.    

### **Code Presentation:**

For a bit of context, since this is earlier in devlopment the code may seem unorgalized. But I'm still fixing it and making changes to the code. Since I'm learning the basics of `pygame` I have to start small. So the first I did was that I needed to learn how  

**Preview:**
```py
window = Tk()
window. title ("new pygame")
window. resizable(False, False)
score = 0
direction = 'down'
label = Label (window, text="Score:{}", format (score))
window.mainloop ()
```
