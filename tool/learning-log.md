### Section #1: (10/6/25)

Now one thing I had issues with was running the code bug free. So that got me to look into further and what I saw was that I needed a add-on type program to check for bugs in the code. Here is the preview of the code:     

```PY
from CODE import FUNCTION

def main(): # define the main part of list FIRST before testing the function
test_FUNCTION()

def test_FUNCTION():
if FUNCTION(VALUE1) != VALUE2:
print("ERROR: INCORRECT VALUE STATE") # error text if not true into termal

if __name__ == "__main__"
main()
```

For some context, this program isn't apart perhaps but something to add on the code. How this code works is _like I said before,_ it just bug for bug by testing the function with `def test_FUNCTION():`. Then it checks if the first value _(that should be already set)_ isn't the same as what the code should be, print the statment: `ERROR: INCORRECT VALUE STATE`. Which is just a fancy way of saying something in the code is not right because I have all the values that are the right way of printing.
